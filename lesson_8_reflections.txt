the staging area is well named, it's like a preperation area
before committing. the working directory is the file structure
where everything is located locally on a machine. A repository
is a working directory with a .git file in it, it can be
uploaded to github and cloned down from github. the staged
changes will not be uploaded to github unless committed, and
staging something does not change anything in the working
directory.
